## Welcome to My Portfolio!

### About

Hi! I am in my penultimate year of study in B.Tech (Electronics and Communication Engineering) at Techno India University.
I am a self-driven, insightful learner, who is passionate about electronics and computers, and a conversation roller. Having grown my skills in C, HTML and Paint 3D, I am gravitating towards CSS, Python, Java, and Virtual Reality. Dreamt of being an astronomer as a child: inspired by my Grandma's gift of "Amazing Space" by Parragon Books, and starcharts. I yearn for developing my first interactive website. Currently have a lot of tinkering ideas and interesting C projects under my belt.

### How My Journey Started

I'm obsessed with being flexible, and coming up with overhauled, refreshable solutions. My first memories of programming are of Logo - Turtle at age 9. I tend to latch onto digital circuitry projects more than anything. You can also find me penning down poems out of the blue. I never like to put my abilities at stake. Peak life achievements -
